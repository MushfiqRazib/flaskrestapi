history |     
    sed 's/^ \+//;s/  / /' |     
    cut -d' ' -f2- |     
    awk '/^sudo/{ count[$0]++ } END { for (i in count) print count[i], i }' |     
    sort -rn


Explanation:
1. sed command remove the leading spaces and convert the double space after the history command number to a single space:
   history | sed 's/^ \+//;s/  / /'

2. cut command is used to remove the first column (the history numbers): 
   cut -d' ' -f2- |

3. awk command is used to record how many times 'sudo' command has been seen:
   awk '/^sudo/{ count[$0]++ } END { for (i in count) print count[i], i }' | 

4. Then we sort the output numerically and reverse it:
   sort -rn
